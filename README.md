# Introduction

This repo contains the outline and examples for my brief talk "tools for constructing software."

# Outline

- general theme: strong programmers don't need tools--but the rest of us do, so ignore the strong programmers
  - Rob Pike: "Syntax highlighting is juvenile. When I was a child, I was taught arithmetic using colored rods. I grew up and today I use monochromatic numerals" - Rob Pike is very, very wrong
- code-and-fix
- syntax highlighting
  - Syntax highlighting is missing in places! e.g. Handlebars template strings; string interpolation
- linting - squigglies and format-on-save tools like prettier
- logging
- tests
- REPL - vanilla REPL
- debugger - REPL in your text editor
- someone else talk about how a strong type system helps - being guided by the compiler - QED
- without type safety, precondition checks (design by contract)
- design techniques?
